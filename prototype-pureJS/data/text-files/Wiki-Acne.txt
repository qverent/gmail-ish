Acne, also known as acne vulgaris, is a long-term skin disease that occurs when dead skin cells and oil from the skin clog hair follicles.[10] Typical features of the condition include blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring.[1][2][11] It primarily affects skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, upper part of the chest, and back.[12] The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem, and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.[3][4]

Genetics is the primary cause of acne in 80% of cases.[2] The role of diet and cigarette smoking in the condition is unclear, and neither cleanliness nor exposure to sunlight appears to play a part.[2][13][14] In both sexes, hormones called androgens appear to be part of the underlying mechanism, by causing increased production of sebum.[5] Another common factor is the excessive growth of the bacterium Cutibacterium acnes, which is present on the skin.[15]

Treatments for acne are available, including lifestyle changes, medications, and medical procedures. Eating fewer simple carbohydrates such as sugar may minimize the condition.[7] Treatments applied directly to the affected skin, such as azelaic acid, benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid, are commonly used.[8] Antibiotics and retinoids are available in formulations that are applied to the skin and taken by mouth for the treatment of acne.[8] However, resistance to antibiotics may develop as a result of antibiotic therapy.[16] Several types of birth control pills help against acne in women.[8] Medical professionals typically reserve isotretinoin pills for severe acne, due to greater potential side effects.[8][17] Early and aggressive treatment of acne is advocated by some in the medical community to decrease the overall long-term impact on individuals.[4]

In 2015, acne affected approximately 633 million people globally, making it the eighth-most common disease worldwide.[9][18] Acne commonly occurs in adolescence and affects an estimated 80â€“90% of teenagers in the Western world.[19][20][21] Some rural societies report lower rates of acne than industrialized ones.[21][22] Children and adults may also be affected before and after puberty.[23] Although acne becomes less common in adulthood, it persists in nearly half of affected people into their twenties and thirties, and a smaller group continues to have difficulties in their forties.[2]
