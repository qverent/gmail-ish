Dementia is a broad category of brain diseases that cause a long-term and often gradual decrease in the ability to think and remember that is severe enough to affect daily functioning.[2] Other common symptoms include emotional problems, difficulties with language, and a decrease in motivation.[2][3] Consciousness is usually not affected.[11] A diagnosis of dementia requires a change from a person's usual mental functioning and a greater decline than one would expect due to aging.[2][12] These diseases have a significant effect on caregivers.[2]

The most common type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease, which makes up 50% to 70% of cases.[2][3] Other common types include vascular dementia (25%), dementia with Lewy bodies (15%), and frontotemporal dementia.[2][3] Less common causes include normal pressure hydrocephalus, Parkinson's disease dementia, syphilis, HIV, and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease.[13] More than one type of dementia may exist in the same person.[2] A small proportion of cases run in families.[14] In the DSM-5, dementia was reclassified as a neurocognitive disorder, with degrees of severity.[15] Diagnosis is usually based on history of the illness and cognitive testing with medical imaging and blood tests used to rule out other possible causes.[4] The mini mental state examination is one commonly used cognitive test.[3] Efforts to prevent dementia include trying to decrease risk factors such as high blood pressure, smoking, diabetes, and obesity.[2] Screening the general population for the disorder is not recommended.[16]

There is no known cure for dementia.[2] Cholinesterase inhibitors such as donepezil are often used and may be beneficial in mild to moderate disorder.[7][17][18] Overall benefit, however, may be minor.[7][8] There are many measures that can improve the quality of life of people with dementia and their caregivers.[2] Cognitive and behavioral interventions may be appropriate.[2] Educating and providing emotional support to the caregiver is important.[2] Exercise programs may be beneficial with respect to activities of daily living and potentially improve outcomes.[19] Treatment of behavioral problems with antipsychotics is common but not usually recommended, due to the limited benefit and the side effects, including an increased risk of death.[20][21]

Globally, dementia affected about 46 million people in 2015.[9] About 10% of people develop the disorder at some point in their lives.[14] It becomes more common with age.[22] About 3% of people between the ages of 65–74 have dementia, 19% between 75 and 84, and nearly half of those over 85 years of age.[23] In 2013 dementia resulted in about 1.7 million deaths, up from 0.8 million in 1990.[24] As more people are living longer, dementia is becoming more common.[22] For people of a specific age, however, it may be becoming less frequent, at least in the developed world, due to a decrease in risk factors.[22] It is one of the most common causes of disability among the old.[3] It is believed to result in economic costs of US$604 billion a year.[2] People with dementia are often physically or chemically restrained to a greater degree than necessary, raising issues of human rights.[2] Social stigma against those affected is common.[3]

Signs and symptoms

The symptoms of dementia vary across types and stages of the diagnosis.[25] The most commonly affected areas include memory, visual-spatial perception and orientation, language, attention and problem solving. Most types of dementia are slow and progressive. By the time signs of the disorder are apparent, deterioration in the brain has been happening for a long time.

Neuropsychiatric symptoms that may be present are termed Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). These can include problems with:[26]

Balance
Tremor
Speech and language
Eating/swallowing
Memory (believing that a memory has already happened when it has not, thinking an old memory is a new one, combining two memories, or confusing the people in a memory)
Wandering or restlessness
Visual perception[27]
Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia almost always occur in all types of dementia and may manifest as:[28][29]

Agitation
Depression
Anxiety
Abnormal motor behavior
Elated mood
Irritability
Apathy
Disinhibition and impulsivity
Delusions (often believing people are stealing from them) or hallucinations
Changes in sleep or appetite.
When people with dementia are put in circumstances beyond their abilities, they may experience a sudden change to crying or anger (a "catastrophic reaction").[30]

Psychosis (often delusions of persecution) and agitation/aggression also often accompany dementia.[31]

Stages
Mild cognitive impairment
In the first stages of dementia, signs and symptoms may be subtle. Often, the early signs become apparent when looking back in time. The earliest stage of dementia is called mild cognitive impairment (MCI). 70% of those diagnosed with MCI later progress to dementia.[12] In MCI, changes in the person's brain have been happening for a long time, but symptoms are just beginning to appear. These problems, however, are not severe enough to affect daily function. If/once they do, the diagnosis becomes dementia. A person with MCI scores between 27 and 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which is a normal score. They may have some memory trouble and trouble finding words, but they solve everyday problems and competently handle their life affairs.[32]

Early stages
In the early stage of dementia, symptoms become noticeable to others. In addition, the symptoms begin to interfere with daily activities. MMSE scores are between 20 and 25. The symptoms are dependent on the type of dementia. More complicated chores and tasks around the house or at work become more difficult. The person can usually still take care of themselves but may forget things like taking pills or doing laundry and may need prompting or reminders.[33]

The symptoms of early dementia usually include memory difficulty, but can also include some word-finding problems (anomia) and problems with planning and organizational skills (executive function).[34] One very good way of assessing a person's impairment is by asking if they are still able to handle their finances independently. This is often one of the first things to become problematic. Other signs might be getting lost in new places, repeating things, personality changes,[35] social withdrawal and difficulties at work.

When evaluating dementia, it is important to consider how the person functioned five or ten years earlier. It is also important to consider education level when assessing function. For example, an accountant who can no longer balance a checkbook would be more concerning than a person who had not finished high school or had never taken care of their own finances.[12]

In Alzheimer's dementia the most prominent early symptom is memory difficulty. Others include word-finding problems and getting lost. In other types of dementia, such as dementia with Lewy bodies and fronto-temporal dementia, personality changes and difficulty with organization and planning may be the first signs.[36][citation needed]

Middle stages
As dementia progresses, initial symptoms generally worsen. The rate of decline is different for each person. MMSE between scores of 6–17 signal moderate dementia . For example, people with moderate Alzheimer's dementia lose almost all new information. People with dementia may be severely impaired in solving problems, and their social judgment is usually also impaired. They cannot usually function outside their own home, and generally should not be left alone. They may be able to do simple chores around the house but not much else, and begin to require assistance for personal care and hygiene beyond simple reminders
